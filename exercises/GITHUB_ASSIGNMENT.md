## Learning APIs assignment:

Create a command line application that creates a fresh github repository on
your account. It might work something like this:

```
python3 makerepo.py
What would you like to call your repository: haltingproblemsolution
Write a short description: Turing was wrong
```

And this will create a blank (no README, not gitignore) repo on your account
that you can then set as a remote and begin pushing to, all without dealing
with their web interface.

Remember to keep you api keys and access tokens outside of your project
repositories!
